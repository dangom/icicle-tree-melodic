#+TITLE: ICA Icicle Plots
#+AUTHOR: Daniel Gomez
#+DATE: 11.07.2017

A tool to generate icicle plots displaying:
1. The amount of variance in each ICA component;
2.  The amount of variance explained by the dimensionality of the ICA decomposition, in comparison to the full data;
3. Components accepted and rejected by either FIX or ME-ICA cleaning (the only currently supported methods).

Here is an example image:

** Usage

ICA Icicle Plots currently supports FIX and ME-ICA. It will automatically detect what cleaning method was used, if any.
However, if you did use FIX, you'll have to specify the FIX results.txt file yourself. This file usually has a name similar to "fix4melview_blabla.txt".

Directly from the help menu:
#+begin_quote
icicles.py [-h] [--fix FIX] i o

Save an icicle plot to file

positional arguments:
  i           The input ICA directory
  o           The output filename

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --fix FIX   If FIX, the txt containing fix classification results
#+end_quote

** Installation

Clone the repository.

** Dependencies

Python3 with pandas and matplotlib.
